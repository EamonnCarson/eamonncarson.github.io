Hi, I am Eamonn.

This is my research blog where I share articles, notes, and experiments.

I am interested in machine learning, decision-making systems, and writing clear technical explanations.

You can replace the image on the left by adding your own file in `static/images/` and updating `profile_image` in this file.
