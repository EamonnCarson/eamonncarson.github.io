Hi, I am Eamonn.

This is my research blog where I share articles, notes, experiments, and observations.

I am interested in machine learning.

I'd like to own the things that make me smarter.

Here are some of my favorite papers and resources:

- [Language Modelling is Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10668)
- [Lora Without Regret](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/lora/)
- [The modded-nanogpt speedrun](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt)
